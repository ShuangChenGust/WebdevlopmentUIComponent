Requirements:
Use Native Js to design a scroll view, once you click the right or left button, the new image will scrow left from the container. once to the righest or leftest, the button will be unabled.

Notes:
1.CSS transitions:
e.g.change sevearl props:
div {
  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}

the transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

This is for different browser version:
	#slide ul{
		position: absolute;
		-webkit-transition:all .27s ease-in;
		-moz-transition:all .27s ease-in;
		-o-transition:all .27s ease-in;
		transition:all .27s ease-in;}

Key element:
CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary


<a href="javascript:;"></a>
Code like this is therefore sometimes used as a way of making a link, but without having to provide an actual URL in the href attribute. The developer obviously wanted the link itself not to do anything, and this was the easiest way he knew.

He probably has some javascript event code elsewhere which is triggered when the link is clicked, and that will be what he wants to actually happen, but he wants it to look like a normal <a> tag link.
