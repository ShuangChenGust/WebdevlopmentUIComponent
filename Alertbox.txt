Set a <div> element to not be displayed:
 However, if you set display:none, it hides the entire element, while visibility:hidden means that the contents of the element will be invisible, but the element stays in its original position and size.

 Note2:
 Select the <option> element with index "2":

document.getElementById("mySelect").selectedIndex = "2";
